# pk_common_functions
There are many functions in pyFAT and pyHIARD that are useful. However we do not always want to dress programs up with all pyFAT machinery. This is to have a central repository for these functions to keep them up to date.

There is no pypi but downloading the repository and then installing from the directory should allow for a pip install.

i.e:

pip install <path_to_repository>

should install the module pk_common_functions.

function can then be accessed through:

from pk_common_functions.functions import functions

or

import pk_common_functions.functions
